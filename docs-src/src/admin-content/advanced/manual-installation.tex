\section{Manual installation}

\begin{warning}
    Manual installation is not supported.

    The Zimbra Drive Zimlet and Extension are installed during the Zimbra installation.
    Any modification to the installed zimbra packages may lead to a fail during the Zimbra upgrade.
\end{warning}

\subsection{Extension}
    The files zimbradrive-extension.jar and zal.jar must be copied in the right place;
    then a mailbox restart is required to load the extension.
    \begin{verbatim}
# As root
mkdir -p /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive
cp zimbradrive-extension.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/
cp zal.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/

# As zimbra
mailboxdctl restart
    \end{verbatim}
    Everything is successfully done only if extension start correctly and the following string
    should be logged in \texttt{ZIMBRA\_HOME/log/mailbox.log} at the moment of the last mailbox restart:
    \begin{verbatim}
Initialized extension Zimbra Abstraction Layer for: zimbradrive
    \end{verbatim}

\subsection{Zimlet}
    Deploy the zimlet with the following command:
    \begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
zmzimletctl deploy com_zextras_drive_open.zip
    \end{verbatim}
    By default the zimlet is enabled for the `default` COS.
    The zimlet can be enabled on the required COSes from the administration console.
