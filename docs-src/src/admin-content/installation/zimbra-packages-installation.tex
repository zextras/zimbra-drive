\section{Zimbra packages installation}

In this section is described how to install the Zimbra Drive Extension and the Zimbra Drive Zimlet.

Both Extension and Zimlet are installed through the official Zimbra installer,
indeed Zimbra installation inquires for Zimbra Drive installation.
Zimbra Drive Extension and Zimbra Drive Zimlet will be installed Answering
"Yes" to the following questions in Zimbra installation:

\begin{verbatim}
Use Zimbra's package repository [Y] Yes
...
Install zimbra-drive [Y] Yes
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Zimbra already installed}

The Zimbra installation adds the Zimbra repositories to apt sources list,
so Zimbra Drive can be installed through the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
# As root, when apt-get is available
apt-get update
apt-get install zimbra-drive
# As root, when yum is available
yum update
yum install zimbra-drive
\end{verbatim}

zmzimletctl deploy /opt/zimbra/zimlets/com_zextras_drive_open.zip
zmmailboxd  restart
